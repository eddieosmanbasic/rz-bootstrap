###A little checklist to make sure that everything has been modified after development is completed:

1. Comment markup inside of HTML's and/or PHP files
2. Add share button to the site before send off
    * Make sure that the colors match the site as well
3. Clean up the directories from unused `plugins`, `fonts`, and `css files`
4. Change information at the top of layout.css and scripts.js
5. Check if client is an existing client before sendoff
